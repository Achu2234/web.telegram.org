## New: Bypass ISP Blocks using your own Domain

## Why this Repo?

Telegram is banned in several countries, in India Telegram is blocked on several networks including Jio and Airtel. So in this repo i will continuously provide new domains to access Telegram without compromising privacy or security of your data. You can now create your own telegram app on your custom domain so bypass blocks.

## Blocked URLs by Different Countries

* https://*.web.telegram.org
* `*` can be replaced with ["pluto","venus","aurora","vesta","flora"]
* `*` can be replaced with ["pluto-1","venus-1","aurora-1","vesta-1","flora-1"]
* I've added these APIs directly into base domain/subdomain using Proxy and making it accessible via Single domain.

## Where to deploy

* Currently this App can only be used on Netlify and Vercel.
* Deploying this app directly on any other platform will create known issue and it'll not work at all.

## Deploy on Vercel and Netlify
